# interview-takeawaytask2
This repository is for the purposes of software engineering interviews.

It is intended to be a snapshot of a small portion of the real platform, mangled into a small enough state where it can be stood up on its own and with enough logic that someone could make small changes to it in isolation.

The real codebase DOES NOT look like and is NOT laid out like this!

# TASK
1. Clone the code. Build and run/debug to get a feel for it. It is a VERY cut down section of a User Service section with a lot of things 'faked'. There should be a swagger page at https://localhost:5001 for all of your testing needs.

2. Read the Create User Update Endpoint issue (see issues) - or here - https://github.com/kaizenticketing/interview-takeawaytask2/issues/1.

3. Create a fresh branch to work from and try to implement the task in the issue above.

4. When you are happy with your work, create a branch if you haven't already and push your code to the branch in github, and let Neil know when you're done. Don't forget to publish your branch and create a PR.

Do NOT spend any longer than two hours on this, I do not expect an extended period of effort. I want to understand how you break a problem down.

ALSO DO NOT USE CHAT GPT OR ANY OTHER AI TECHNOLOGIES FOR THIS TASK. This task is designed to see your capabilities and assess your skill level not chat GPTs.
